            <h2>What is Flutter?</h2>
            Flutter is Google’s portable UI toolkit for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. Flutter works with existing code, is used by developers and organizations around the world, and is free
            and open source.
            <h2>What does Flutter do?</h2>
            For users, Flutter makes beautiful app UIs come to life. For developers, Flutter lowers the bar to entry for building mobile apps. It speeds up development of mobile apps and reduces the cost and complexity of app production across platforms. For designers,
            Flutter helps deliver the original design vision, without loss of fidelity or compromises. It also acts as a productive prototyping tool.
            <h2>Who is Flutter for?</h2>
            Flutter is for developers that want a faster way to build beautiful mobile apps, or a way to reach more users with a single investment. Flutter is also for engineering managers that need to lead mobile development teams. Flutter allows eng managers to
            create a single mobile app dev team, unifying their development investments to ship more features faster, ship the same feature set to iOS and Android at the same time, and lower maintenance costs. While not the initial target audience, Flutter
            is also for designers that want their original design visions delivered consistently, with high fidelity, to all users on mobile. Fundamentally, Flutter is for users that want beautiful apps, with delightful motion and animation, and UIs with
            character and an identity all their own.
            <h2>What kinds of apps can I build with Flutter?</h2>
            Flutter is optimized for 2D mobile apps that want to run on both Android and iOS. Apps that need to deliver brand-first designs are particularly well suited for Flutter. However, apps that need to look like stock platform apps can also be built with Flutter.
            You can build full-featured apps with Flutter, including camera, geolocation, network, storage, 3rd-party SDKs, and more.
            <h2>Who makes Flutter?</h2>
            Flutter is an open source project, with contributions from Google and the community.
            <h2>Who uses Flutter?</h2>
            Developers inside and outside of Google use Flutter to build beautiful native apps for iOS and Android. To learn about some of these apps, visit the <a href="https://flutter.dev/showcase">showcase</a>.
            <h1>What does Flutter provide?</h1>
            <br>
            <h2>What is inside the Flutter SDK?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Heavily optimized, mobile-first 2D rendering engine with excellent support for text</li>
                <li>Modern react-style framework</li>
                <li>Rich set of widgets for Android and iOS</li>
                <li>APIs for unit and integration tests</li>
                <li>Interop and plugin APIs to connect to the system and 3rd-party SDKs</li>
                <li>Headless test runner for running tests on Windows, Linux, and Mac</li>
                <li>Command-line tools for creating, building, testing, and compiling your apps</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Does Flutter come with a framework?</h2>
            Yes! Flutter ships with a modern framework, inspired by React. Flutter’s framework is designed to be layered and customizable (and optional). Developers can choose to use only parts of the framework, or a different framework.
            <h2>Does Flutter come with widgets?</h2>
            Yes! Flutter ships with a set of <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets">high quality Material Design and Cupertino (iOS-style) widgets</a>, layouts, and themes. Of course, these widgets are only a starting point. Flutter
            is designed to make it easy to create your own widgets, or customize the existing widgets.
            <h2>How does Flutter run my code on Android?</h2>
            The engine’s C and C++ code are compiled with Android’s NDK. The Dart code (both the SDK’s and yours) are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into a native, ARM and x86 libraries. Those libraries are included in a “runner” Android project, and the whole thing
            is built into an APK. When launched, the app loads the Flutter library. Any rendering, input or event handling, and so on, is delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code. This is similar to the way many game engines work. Debug mode builds
            use a virtual machine (VM) to run Dart code (hence the “debug” banner they show to remind people that they’re slightly slower) in order to enable Stateful Hot Reload.
            <h2>How does Flutter run my code on iOS?</h2>
            The engine’s C and C++ code are compiled with LLVM. The Dart code (both the SDK’s and yours) are ahead-of-time (AOT) compiled into a native, ARM library. That library is included in a “runner” iOS project, and the whole thing is built into an .ipa. When
            launched, the app loads the Flutter library. Any rendering, input or event handling, and so on, are delegated to the compiled Flutter and app code. This is similar to the way many game engines work. Debug mode builds use a virtual machine
            (VM) to run Dart code (hence the “debug” banner they show to remind people that they’re slightly slower) in order to enable Stateful Hot Reload.
